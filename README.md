<h3> Business Problems <h3>

Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service. It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, modification and transportation with a few touches on your computer or smart phone. It is desired to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning by using the data set containing the service users and the services and categories these users have received.



<h3> Dataset Story <h3>
